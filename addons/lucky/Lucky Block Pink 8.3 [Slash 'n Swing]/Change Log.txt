Notes:
First time Pink Love Potion has been updated since Luck Block Pink 7.0 [Did Somebody Say Update] which released Feb 12th, 2022.
First update since Lucky Block Pink 3.0 which released November 22nd, 2015 to release in November, this is also the second ever update to release in November.
As of this update every single wishing well from the 4.0 Series, 5.0, and 6.0 Series is back meaning every single Wishing Well ever from Lucky Block Pink History is back!
The next update, Lucky Block Pink 8.4 will be focusing on natural structures and new drop types as well as including content I didn't add in this update to prevent burn out!
As of this update Lucky Block Pink's drops.txt is longer than Lucky Block Pink 6.9.2 [Traders and Traitors] in terms of characters which previously held the record of longest drops.txt in Lucky Block Pink history.
The Main Goal of this update was to finally update the Pink Lucky Sword, Pink Lucky Bow, and Pink Love Potion as those haven't been updated to current standard yet as well as adding new structure variants. Also continuing the trend of the last update by reintroducing some older drops, this time focusing more from 3.0 onwards albiet in lesser amounts.
